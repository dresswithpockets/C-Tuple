# C-Tuple
C Tuple is a simple set of functions and a struct that mirrors a basic Tuple type found in C++, C# and other multi-paradigm languages.

## Usuage
Simply add the Tuple.h and Tuple.c files to your C or C++ project, or any other project that supports native/external function invokation. You should beable to call CreateTable and DestroyTable freely.

If you need a DLL for PInvoke, there is a compiled one in the /lib/ folder, along with the same Tuple.h file.
